# GoogleSheetsSpellbook

This repo is for storing practice with the Google API Python Client. The current use case is for managing the mints sheet for GENEPIO, but may branch out into other applications in the future.

**Getting Started:**

Install the [google-api-python-client package from conda::forge](https://anaconda.org/channels/conda-forge/packages/google-api-python-client/overview). 

* If using ```tamarisk``` (Madeline's laptop, b. January 2020 AD), it's inside the virtual Conda environment called ```google-mint```, installed with Python 3.13.11.
* For reference, here's the [GitHub repo for the Google API Python Client](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/tree/main/docs).
